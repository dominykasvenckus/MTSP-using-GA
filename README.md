# MTSP-using-GA
This project uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP). The data is read from the Excel sheet using EPPlus library, and the results for each traveler are placed in the results folder as .txt files. Feel free to test different GA parameter values and compare the results.
